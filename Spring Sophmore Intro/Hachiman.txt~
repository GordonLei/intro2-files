NOUNs naturally form NoUN1s.
NOUN form ADJECTIVE NOUNs within their NoUN1s.
Those that VERB to become NOUNs harbor the burden of failure until they die.
I'm sure the NOUNs feel guilt as they sacrifice their comrades to evade their NOUNs and live on.
In this world, forming NoUN1s yields no benefit for the individual.
Thus, I choose the way of the ADJECTIVE NoUN2, which does not form NoUN1s.
The NoUN2 finds no NOUN in living alone.
He is ADJECTIVE.
He is a lone wolf.
Furthermore, they VERB in the NOUN.
How wonderful that must be.
There is no doubt in my mind.
In my next life, I want to be a NoUN2. '''
