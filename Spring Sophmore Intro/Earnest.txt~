NaME1:  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table]
Lady NaME2:  Won't you come and VERB here, Gwendolen?
Gwendolen:  Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.
NaME1:  [Picking up empty plate in horror]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why are there no NoUN1 sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.
Lane:  [Gravely]  There were no NoUN1s in the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.
NaME1:  No NoUN1s!
Lane:  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.
NaME1:  That will do, Lane, thank you.
Lane:  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out] 
NaME1:  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no NoUN1s, not even for ready money.
Lady NaME2:  It really makes no matter, NaME1.  I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be VERB entirely for pleasure now.
NaME1:  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
Lady NaME2:  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of course, cannot say.
[NaME1 crosses and hands tea]  Thank you.  I've quite a treat for you to-night, NaME1.  I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.
She is such a ADJECTIVE woman, and so ADJECTIVE to her husband.  It's delightful to watch them.
NaME1:  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.
Lady NaME2:  [Frowning]  I hope not, NaME1.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to VERB upstairs.  Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
NaME1:  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.
[Exchanges glances with Jack]  They seem to think I should be with him.
Lady NaME2:  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.
NaME1:  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.
Lady NaME2:  Well, I must say, NaME1, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.
Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of life.
I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.
I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my NOUN for me.
It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.'''
