To VERB, or not to VERB--that is the NOUN: <br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the NOUN to VERB <br>
The NOUNs and NOUNs of ADJECTIVE fortune <br>
Or to take NOUNs against a sea of NOUNs <br>
And by opposing end them. To VERB, to VERB-- <br>
No more--and by a VERB to say we end <br>
The heartache, and the thousand ADJECTIVE VERB <br>
That flesh is heir to. '''
