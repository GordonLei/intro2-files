2016-05-27:

In Class:
-Stanley rewrote all of the files to incorporate objects/classes and the module pickle. 
-I will be using his new python file now.
-We created the upvote/downvote buttons.
-We replaced the original comment button (was a button with the postObj.id as the value) with a link instead
	-So the link is now: <a href=PYTHON FILE HERE> Comment </a>

2016-05-30:

At Home:
-Stanley mass re-wrote all of the codes to better incorporate python classes. 
	-Basically he cleaned up all the code to make it neater and not kill people's eyesight and brain cells. 
-I took ~one hour reading about python classes in order to help incorporate it into our files.
-I editied profile.py to add a search bar for usernames.
	-This links to search.py that I created.
		- This .py file shows the "searched user"'s posts and if the name exists. 
		- Add-Friend Option (33% done)
			-Does not allow you to add yourself
			-Adding new friends works [Does not work yet]
			-Does not allow you to add new friends [Does not work yet]
			-Sends friend request [Did nto start on yet]

2016-05-31:

In Class:
-Stanley compelted the inbox portion of the project and is starting on the adding friend option.
-I am working on improving upvotes/downvotes:
	-worked on the concept of how to upvote/downvote

At home:
-I revised the upvotes/downvotes system so it now has a limit (one person cannot have two votes but they can change from up vote to downvote)
	-Works on profile.py
-Worked on adding upvotes/downvotes on search.py:
	-It works but there is a slight lag / time-issue. (You need to press the vote link twice in order to see the new changes)
-

2016-06-02:

In Class:
-Began to revise upvotes/downvotes for postExpanded.py (the comment section).

At Home:
-Completed the voting system for postExpanded.py + the limitations on voting for that part.
-Created postExpandedSearch.py (for commenting on posts that you search/ posts that you did not make). 
	-Now this file allows you to comment on other people's posts.

2016-06-03:
In Class:
-Began working on groups.py
	-This will allow facebook-like groups to be made.
	-Mainly worked on the __init__ parts of the Group objects and what functions/attributes to include in it.

2016-06-04:
At home:
-After many hours, blood, sweat, tears, water, etc./whatever makes this sound cool, I completed the part to make groups.
	-Groups can now be created and if the name is already taken, you cannot make that group.
	-You can view groups which redirects you to groupsPage.py (this is the posting section of the groups).

PROBLEMS: 
-Add member / kick member on groupsPage.py does not work.

2016-06-05:
At home:
-;=; I fixed the kick/add member (I did not call the name attributes of the object). 
-I added the part where you cannot kick yourself.
	-Also made kick/add member only display if you are the admin. 
-Groups can now post things onto the group.
	-Include upvotes/downvotes.
-I noticed that I limited the votes incorrectly:
	-Say you upvoted once but want to change your choice. Assume the post is at '0' and when you upvote, it becomes '1'
	-When you downvote to remove your upvote, it goes to '0' not '-1'.
-Fixed voting on most if not all of the .py files. 
	-Made an option to remove your votes.
	-Remove votes does not work yet for some reason.

2016-06-06:
In Class:
-Never mind, voting actually works after I fixed it yesterday.
-Tried making 'remove votes' pop the key from the dictionary but it does not remove votes.
